	abstract = {Phenological studies are fundamental to our understanding of how the environment can inﬂuence plant growth and reproductive processes. Environmental triggers of fern phenology are poorly known. We investigated the leaf phenological traits of the tree fern Cyathea praecincta (Kunze) Domin in a Brazilian lowland tropical forest with a short dry season. We monitored 47 plants over an 18-month period, measuring leaf production, leaf fertility, leaf mortality and the relation of these variables with rainfall and temperature. Data on leaf expansion and lifespan were also presented. Full leaf expansion in C. praecincta took up to 3 months. The production of sterile and fertile leaves showed dissimilar interactions with climate, a common pattern among most tree ferns studied worldwide. Whereas production of sterile leaves of C. praecincta was not inﬂuenced by climatic variability, leaf fertility was driven by increasing rainfall. Some fertile plants (30\%) produced exclusively fertile leaves and attained full maturity, playing a key role in the maintenance and growth of the population. The estimated leaf lifespan was 17.9 Æ 5.89 months. The ﬁnding that leaf mortality was driven by decreasing rainfall is in contrast with most tree ferns, which are not inﬂuenced by climate. None of the phenological variables was inﬂuenced by temperature. We demonstrated that rainfall plays a crucial role on leaf fertility and leaf mortality of C. praecincta in a tropical forest remnant with a short dry season and inversely related rainfall and temperature.},

	abstract = {This paper describes the phenology of leaf, flower, and fruit phenology in the Atlantic rain forests of southeastern Brazil. For 17 months, we observed the phenological patterns of trees from two Atlantic forest types at four sites: prcmontane forest (Sites I and IV; the “typical” Atlantic rain forest) and coastal plain forest (Sites I1 and 111). All sites experience a nonseasonal, tropical wet climate, characterized by an annual rainfall usually {\textgreater} 2000 mm and lacking a dry season. We tested for the occurrence (or absence) of seasonal phenological patterns within each site and compared the patterns detected among the four different forest sites using circular statistics. The expected weakly seasonal phenological patterns were not observed for these forests. Flowering and leaf flush patterns of Atlantic rain forest trees were significantly seasonal, concentrated at the beginning of the wettest season, and were significantly correlated with day length and temperature. These results stress the influence that seasonal variation in day length has on ever-wet forest tree phenology. Fruiting phenologies were aseasonal in all four forests. Flowering patterns did not differ significantly among three of the four forest sites analyzed, suggesting the occurrence of a general flowering pattern for Atlantic rain forest trees.},

	abstract = {This compilation of ferns and lycophytes in Brazil is an update of the one published in 2010 in Catálogo de Plantas e Fungos do Brasil. The methodology consisted in collecting data from regional checklists, taxonomic revisions, and selected databases. Invited specialists improved the list accessing a website housed at the Jardim Botânico do Rio de Janeiro. The results show 1,253 species: 1,111 of ferns and 142 of lycophytes. This number is 6.5\% higher than the previous one (1,176 spp.). The percentage of endemic species decreased from 38.2\% to 36.7\%. We recognized 36 families and 133 genera (vs. 33 families, 121 genera in 2010). The 10 most diverse families are Pteridaceae (196 spp.), Dryopteridaceae (179), Polypodiaceae (164), Hymenophyllaceae (90), Thelypteridaceae (86), Aspleniaceae (78), Lycopodiaceae (64), Selaginellaceae (55), Anemiaceae (51), and Cyatheaceae (45). The three most diverse genera are still Elaphoglossum (87 spp.), Thelypteris (85), and Asplenium (74). The richest phytogeographic domain continues to be in the Atlantic Rainforest with 883 species which also has the largest number of endemic and threatened species, followed by the Amazon Rainforest (503), Cerrado (269), Pantanal (30), Caatinga (26), and Pampa (eight). Minas Gerais remains as the richest state (657 spp. vs. 580 in 2010).},
